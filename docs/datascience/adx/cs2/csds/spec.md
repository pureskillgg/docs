# CSDS Spec

Documentation for CSDS channels built by FPS Critic, Inc.

One match is published as a JSON index object named `csds` plus one file per
channel, 42 in all, for 43 objects per match. The index lists the channels,
where each one sits, and what columns it declares. Every channel file is
[Apache Parquet], `header` included.

This document describes the channel set published since 2026-08-04. Revisions
through 2026-07-31 carry an older set of 30 channels, described in the
[archived spec](/datascience/old/cs2/csds/spec); the 2026-08-02 revision holds
a mix of the two. Reading each match's index object rather than assuming a
channel list will keep code working across the change.

## How to read this

Each section below is one channel. The heading gives the channel name and its
category, and multi-event channels list the game events that write rows into
them.

**Origin** says where a column comes from:

| Origin                | Meaning                                                                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `replay`              | Written by the demo parser, straight off the game's own event stream.                               |
| `replay_fixed`        | A parser value the pipeline recomputed. The uncorrected value stays in the matching `*_raw` column. |
| `replay-capped`       | A parser value clamped to a maximum.                                                                |
| `replay-redacted`     | A parser value removed or replaced by the PII scrubber.                                             |
| `calculated`          | Derived by the pipeline from the columns named under Dependents.                                    |
| `calculated-redacted` | Derived, then removed or replaced by the PII scrubber.                                              |
| `merged`              | Copied in from another channel by joining on the columns named under Merge Keys.                    |

**Dependents** names the columns a calculated column is computed from. A
`channel:column` entry points at another channel, and a `meta:` or `metademo:`
entry at match metadata rather than a channel.

**Merge Keys** names the columns joined on to bring a merged column in. Most
position and velocity columns arrive by an as-of merge against the nearest tick
at or before the event, so they are null when no source row is close enough.

**Type** is the value type as published. Integers are written as Parquet
`int64` and floats as `double`, because the writer goes through pandas; a
column typed `int` here that can hold nulls therefore arrives as a double, and
the note in the [data dictionary](./assets/csds_dictionary.csv) says so.

**Nullable** is the value declared in the index object where there is one.
Merged columns are always nullable. It is left blank for calculated columns,
which the index does not declare either way.

Four columns that older versions of this document listed are no longer
published: `tick` and `second` on `player_info` and on `player_personal`. The
index still names them, marked as deleted, so a reader driven off the index
should skip any column whose origin ends in `-deleted`.
